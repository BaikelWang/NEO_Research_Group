abstract: <font face='times'>Spectroscopy is a technique that analyzes the interaction between matter and light as a function of wavelength. It is the most convenient method for obtaining qualitative and quantitative information about an unknown sample with reasonable accuracy. However, traditional spectroscopy is reliant on bulky and expensive spectrometers, while emerging applications of portable, low-cost and lightweight sensing and imaging necessitate the development of miniaturized spectrometers. In this study, we have developed a computational spectroscopy method that can provide single-shot operation, sub-nanometer spectral resolution, and direct materials characterization. This method is enabled by a metasurface integrated computational spectrometer and deep learning algorithms. The identification of critical parameters of optical cavities and chemical solutions is demonstrated through the application of the method, with an average spectral reconstruction accuracy of 0.4 nm and an actual measurement error of 0.32 nm. The mean square errors for the characterization of cavity length and solution concentration are 0.53 % and 1.21 %, respectively. Consequently, computational spectroscopy can achieve the same level of spectral accuracy as traditional spectroscopy while providing convenient, rapid material characterization in a variety of scenarios.</font>
