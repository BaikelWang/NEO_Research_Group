abstract: <font face='times'>Bound states in the continuum (BIC) represent distinct non-radiative states endowed with infinite lifetime and vanishing resonance linewidth. Introducing asymmetric perturbation to the system can convert true BICs into high quality leaky modes which is useful in many photonic applications. Previously, such perturbation and resonance of interest is only limited to a single factor. However, different perturbations by unit cell gap, geometry and rotation angle result distinctive resonance modes. The combination of two perturbation factors can excite multi-mode resonance contributed from each asymmetric factor which coexist simultaneously; thus, the number of reflectance peaks can be controlled. In addition, we have carefully analyzed the electric field variations under different perturbation factors, followed by a multipolar decomposition of resonances to reveal underlying mechanisms of distinct resonance modes. Through simulations, we find that the introduction of multiple asymmetric perturbations also influences the metasurface sensitivity in refractive index sensing and compare the performance of different resonance modes. These observations provide structural design insights for achieving high quality resonance with multiple modes and ultra-sensitive sensing.</font>
