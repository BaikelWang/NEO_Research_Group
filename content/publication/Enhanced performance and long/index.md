abstract: <font face='times'>Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor materials, such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), demonstrate considerable potential for optoelectronic applications, largely due to their atomic thickness, tunable bandgap, and capacity for heterostructure integration. Nevertheless, the development of 2D photodetectors that can achieve high responsivity, a fast response time, and long-term stability remains a significant challenge. The present study is a systematic investigation of the effects of top and bottom encapsulation with hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) on the performance and stability of 2D photodetectors. By employing a dry transfer process to fabricate a high-quality h-BN/MoS2/h-BN structure, we provide effective protection against environmental degradation. The encapsulated devices exhibited a responsivity increase of one to two orders of magnitude under 532 nm laser illumination, in comparison to those without encapsulation. Additionally, the rise and decay times were markedly reduced, by approximately two orders of magnitude, from 0.538 and 3.43 ms to 23.1 and 99.6 μs, respectively. Moreover, the devices demonstrated sustained performance over a 60-day storage period, with response times remaining faster than pre-encapsulation levels. This study highlights the potential of h-BN encapsulation for enhancing both the performance and stability of 2D photodetectors, advancing the development of more reliable optoelectronic devices.</font>
